			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: What is this "Songtrain" thing?</div>
				<div class="a">A: Songtrain is an iOS app that lets people connect their mobile devices to create a locally shared playlist.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: Well, you've got my attention. Can you tell me how to use it?</div>
				<div class="a">A: Well certrainly, internet stranger! First, download Songtrain. Second, make some friends (or use existing friends) and tell them to download Songtrain. Third, launch Songtrain, have your friends join your "train" and have everyone add music to the playlist, either from your personal libraries, or from your Soundcloud accounts. Finally, tap the play button to have the resulting collaborative playlist play through your device. Reorder, delete, and enjoy soundwave democracy!</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: What the what!? I think I get it, but how does it work?</div>
				<div class="a">A: Songtrain makes use of Apple's Multi-Peer Connectivity framework to create an ad-hoc network that passes data (in this case, packets of musical pixie dust) between the connected phones. Simple magic, really. </div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: Well, that is pretty neat. Who can I thank for this blessing of networking genius?</div>
				<div class="a">A: We are a small team of designers, mathematicians, and engineers that function legally as Octave Labs in our free time. No thanks necessary. Instead, send us some critical feedback to help us improve the way you use the product. If you're happy with your experience, a positive App Store rating would be more than enough love!</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: Octave Labs, huh? How did you all meet, and what led to this creation?</div>
				<div class="a">A: The Octave Labs team has been on paper for about a year now, but the collaboration between its team members has spread across many hackathons and competitions over the course of a few years. Songtrain's development and design is the pheonix of a Startup Weekend idea that explored the experience of listening to music with friends in the same room or house. If you want to hear *your* song at a party, pull out your phone, and put it on the Songtrain!  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: That's a great idea, but not all of my friends have music on their iPhones, nor do they use Soundcloud. Will I see support for other streaming services in the future?</div>
				<div class="a">A: We realize that there are many streaming services availabile, and some friends use a wide range of them on a daily basis. The app you just downloaded is the MVP that we are using to test our networking framework with a streaming service that we personally love. Our plans are to include more streaming service integration in future releases, so keep an eye out, and be sure to send us your feedback on what you'd like to see in the future.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: How about that Android? 50% market share, amirite?</div>
				<div class="a">A: Unfortunately, given our part-time availability to this project and company, Android compatibility is not in our immediate projected timeline.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row qa">
				<div class="q">Q: I have more questions, how can I get in touch with the team? </div>
				<div class="a">A: Click on the airplane below to launch your email client. Alternatively, if you're looking for a press kit to write about us, please use this Q&A, as well as the preceding package of asset goodness, for your publication.</div>

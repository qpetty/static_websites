					<h4>
					 	My name is Krisna.</br>

					 <h4>
					 	Below, I'll introduce a few projects that I've worked on. However, I will stop at the introduction. My design work is not the product. It is the process that dictates my design decisions. The products that you see right now will change as user feedback and subsequent design iterations dictate.</br></br>
					 	If you are interested in hearing more about my process, please get in touch. I'd love to discuss it.

				<h2>Songtrain</h2></br>
				<h5>What it is</h5>
				<h4>
					Songtrain is an iOS application that creates ad-hoc networks with the people around you, allowing a group to create communal playlists on a single device from the music libraries of multiple iOS devices.
				</h4></br>
				<h5>My role</h5>
				<h4>
					Songtrain is the night-time gig I've been working on with two amazing engineers. I have been functioning as the product designer, which has allowed me to wear all kinds of hats. My primary responsibilities include ideation, competitive analysis, user research, personae and scenario creation, wireframing, user testing, and visual design.
				</h4></br>
				<h5>Lean UX</h5>
				<h4>
					Songtrain was also the subject of a Lean UX Case Study that I wrote for my senior project at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. My hopes were to create Lean UX guidelines that could be followed by any hackathon competitor, with the use of Songtrain's design and development process as an example.

				<h2>MINDBODY</h2></br>
				<h5>What it is</h5>
				<h4>
					MINDBODY is the largest cloud-based software provider in the health, wellness and beauty industries.
				</h4></br>
				<h5>My Role</h5>
				<h4>
					Following a summer internship at MINDBODY, I was brought on board MINDBODY's growing UX Team to work as a Jr. UX Designer. While initially working under the Lead UX Designer, my responsibilities have grown to designing for my own scrum team as my skills in the field have developed. I am now a Mobile UX Designer at MINDBODY, focusing on our iOS products.
				</h4></br>
				<h5>My impact</h5>
				<h4>
					My internship started as MINDBODY's UX Team was starting to expand, which has allowed me to observe, and have an influence on, the UX processes of a rapidly growing cloud-based software provider.

					<h5>My Role</h5>
					<h4>
						I joined Tribe's young team as an intern for the summer of 2012 and worked as a web/UI designer and developer. Being on a team of six members, four of whom were interns, I had the opportunity to experience a truly lean startup process. Upon concluding my internship, I continued to work with Tribe as a part-time software and design consultant.
					</h4></br>
					<h5>Life after tribe</h5>
					<h4>
						While originally being brought onto the team as a Software and Mathematics Intern, by the end of the summer I had immersed myself into UI and UX design, while simultaneously teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My time with Tribe was the foundation of my design career and the source of my affinity towards startup life.
